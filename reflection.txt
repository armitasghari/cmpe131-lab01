Using branches is powerful because it allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes without interfering with the main codebase. Each branch acts like a separate workspace where changes can be developed, tested, and committed independently. This keeps the main branch stable and functional while new ideas or updates are being built. Once a feature is complete and tested, it can safely be merged back into the main branch. Branches also help prevent problems such as accidentally breaking working code, overwriting teammates’ changes, and creating confusion about which version of the project is correct. By isolating work into separate branches, teams reduce the risk of conflicts and make it easier to track changes. If something goes wrong in a feature branch, it does not affect the main project, which makes collaboration safer and more organized.
A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically combine changes from two branches because the same part of a file was modified differently in each branch. Git does not know which version is correct, so it pauses the merge process and asks the developer to manually resolve the conflict. This typically happens when two contributors edit the same lines of a file independently. It is important to pull the latest changes from the remote main branch before merging your own feature branch because it ensures your local repository is up to date with the team’s most recent work. If you do not pull first, your branch may be based on outdated code, which increases the likelihood of conflicts and integration issues. Pulling early allows you to resolve conflicts sooner, reduce unexpected errors, and maintain a smoother and safer collaboration workflow.
