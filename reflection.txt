Using branches is powerful because it allowes developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Each branch isolates changes, which makes collaboration safer and more organized. Team members can work independently without breaking stable code. Branches also help prevent conflicts and accidental overwriting of others work. By emerging changes intentionally and reviewing them first, reams reduce bugs and maintain a clean project history.When I merged my feature branch into main, Git detected a merge conflict in CONTRIBUTORS.md because both the github version and my local version modified the same file. Git inserted conflict makers showing the differences between the two versions. I manually edited the file to remove the conflict markers and kept both contributors names. After resolving the conflict, I staged the file and commited the merge to complete the process
