When I merged my feature branch into main, Git detected a merge conflict in CONTRIBUTORS.md because both the github version and my local version modified the same file. Git inserted conflict makers showing the differences between the two versions. I manually edited the file to remove the conflict markers and kept both contributors names. After resolving the conflict, I staged the file and commited the merge to complete the process
